# Prompt Refinement Skill

## Purpose

Help users improve prompts for large language models by:

- clarifying intent and constraints
- suggesting minimal, high-impact rewrites
- providing example inputs and expected outputs
- recommending model parameters and evaluation tests

## Usage

- Use trigger words like `refine`, `optimize prompt`, or `improve prompt`.
- Accepts: original prompt, target model, desired tone, and output format.
- Returns: rewritten prompts (1–3 variants), rationale for changes, and simple evaluation checklist.

## Limitations

- Does not perform fine-tuning; focuses on prompt-level improvements.
- Users should validate outputs across target models and seeds.

## Examples

- Input: "Write an ad for coffee"
- Output: Variants with audience, tone, CTA, and length guidance.

## Maintenance

- Category: `ai-skills`
