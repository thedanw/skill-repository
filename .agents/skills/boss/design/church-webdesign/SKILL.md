# Church Web Design

> **Core philosophy:** Make the next action obvious. Build from user goals upward. Systemise visuals. Validate early. Every design decision must serve the church's mission of welcoming and connecting people.

## Why this exists

Church websites fail when they:

*   don't match visitor goals (first-timers can't find service times),
*   hide key actions (give, plan a visit, watch a sermon),
*   require too much thinking,
*   or are visually inconsistent with the church's welcoming culture.

This skill turns vague requests like "make it look better" into a **repeatable workflow** that produces:

*   clear structure that guides visitors to their next step,
*   usable interactions that serve both guests and members,
*   and a cohesive visual system that reflects your church's unique identity.

## What "done" looks like

Deliverables should be **usable by builders** (engineers, no-code builders, future agents):

*   **Design brief**: users (first-timers, members, seekers), goals, constraints, success metrics.
*   **IA + flows**: sitemap (or nav model), and 1–3 key user journeys (e.g., "Plan Your Visit").
*   **Layout + wireframes**: responsive page structure, component inventory.
*   **Visual system**: tokens (type, spacing, colour, radius, shadow), and usage rules.
*   **Component specs**: states, behaviour, empty/loading/error.
*   **QA notes**: accessibility, responsiveness, edge cases.

If time is limited, prioritise: **clarity + hierarchy + consistency + accessibility**.

---

## Design Workflow (Church-Specific Adaptation)

### Step 0 — Gather inputs (fast)

Ask only what's needed; otherwise assume and state assumptions.

**Minimum questions:**

*   **Primary user**: first-time visitors? regular members? both?
*   **Primary goal**: what must they do? (plan a visit, watch sermon, give, join a group)
*   **Business goal**: what does success look like? (attendance, giving, engagement)
*   **Content**: what is real copy/data? (sermons, events, staff bios)
*   **Brand signals**: existing colours/logo/type/voice? denomination?
*   **Constraints**: tech stack, deadline, accessibility level.

If inputs are missing, create a **working brief** with explicit assumptions.

### Step 1 — Strategy (align intent)

Produce:

*   primary + secondary user goals,
*   business objectives,
*   success metrics,
*   constraints/risk.

**Church-specific considerations:**

*   74% of first-time website visitors land on the homepage (Ministry Designs)
*   Top pages: Home, Staff/About, New Here — prioritise these
*   Over 50% of church website traffic comes from mobile devices

### Step 2 — Scope (decide what exists)

Define:

*   pages/screens (see Essential Pages below),
*   features (sermon player, giving, events calendar, live stream),
*   content requirements,
*   and what is out of scope.

Pick 1–3 **key paths** (the journeys that matter most):

1. **First-time visitor** → Find service times → Plan a visit
2. **Regular member** → Watch sermon → Give → Join a group
3. **New community member** → Explore ministries → Get involved

### Step 3 — Structure (make it findable)

Create:

*   sitemap / nav model (global + local nav),
*   page purpose statements,
*   user flows for key paths.

**Church navigation principles:**

*   Clear, self-explanatory labels: Home, About Us, Ministries, Church Online, Give, Plan Your Visit
*   Streamlined menu prioritizing first-time visitors
*   Remove non-mission-critical items from main navigation
*   Use website analytics to inform navigation decisions
*   Navigation labels should be self‑evident; avoid internal jargon

### Step 4 — Skeleton (arrange the UI)

Create:

*   wireframes per page,
*   component inventory,
*   layout constraints (container widths, grids, spacing rhythm),
*   and priority order per breakpoint.

**Rule:** start with the **feature/content**, not the "app shell".

### Step 5 — Surface (make it beautiful)

Build a consistent system:

*   spacing + sizing scale,
*   typography scale,
*   colour palette + shades,
*   radius + border rules,
*   elevation/shadow scale,
*   icon + illustration style,
*   motion rules (optional).

Apply to page comps.

### Step 6 — Validate (fast loops)

Run these checks:

*   **Glance test (5–10 seconds):** can someone tell what this is and what to do?
*   **Key‑path walkthrough:** can a first‑time user complete the main task?
*   **Consistency pass:** are tokens respected? is hierarchy consistent?
*   **Accessibility pass:** contrast, focus states, semantics, error messaging.

### Step 7 — Hand-off (make it buildable)

Provide:

*   tokens,
*   component specs (states + spacing + behaviour),
*   responsive rules,
*   and edge cases.

## Non‑Negotiable Design Principles

### 1) Reduce thinking

Design so users rarely wonder:

*   "Where am I?"
*   "What do I do next?"
*   "Is that clickable?"
*   "Why did they call it that?"

Prefer **obvious** over clever. For church visitors, this means:

*   Service times and location visible within 5 seconds
*   "Plan Your Visit" button obvious on every page
*   Contact information always accessible

### 2) Use conventions aggressively

Use familiar patterns unless there is a measured reason to deviate. Unusual UI is a tax on every user interaction.

**Church conventions to follow:**

*   Header: logo left, navigation right, service times in header or hero
*   Footer: address, contact, social links, quick links, giving link
*   Hero: welcoming image + clear headline + primary CTA

### 3) Clear visual hierarchy

Every screen must answer (at a glance):

*   what this page is,
*   what the primary action is,
*   where the navigation is,
*   what is secondary.

**Church-specific hierarchy:**

*   Homepage: Welcome → Service Times → Plan a Visit CTA
*   About page: Who We Are → What We Believe → Meet Our Team
*   Ministries: Overview → Age Groups → How to Get Involved

### 4) Grouping must be unambiguous

If spacing is doing grouping work:

*   there must be **more space around groups than within groups**.

### 5) Feedback and forgiveness

Users should:

*   see results of actions quickly,
*   understand system status,
*   and recover via undo/back/cancel where possible.

Prevent errors over scolding users.

### 6) Accessibility is part of "beautiful"

Good aesthetics survive:

*   keyboard-only use,
*   low vision,
*   colour‑blindness,
*   small screens,
*   slow networks.

## Default Starter System

Use this system unless the project already has one.

### Spacing & sizing scale (px)

Use a **non-linear** scale so choices are easy:
`0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128`

Rules:

*   pick from the scale; avoid "one-off" numbers.
*   for grouping: **inside-group spacing < between-group spacing**.

### Typography scale (px)

Keep it tight: 6–8 sizes is enough.

Suggested:

*   `12` caption
*   `14` small/body-secondary
*   `16` body
*   `20` subheading
*   `24` h3
*   `30` h2
*   `40` h1/hero

Rules:

*   default body line-height ~ `1.5–1.7`.
*   limit line length for reading (~45–80 characters).
*   use weight/colour/spacing before adding new sizes.

### Colour system

*   define neutrals (backgrounds + text), one primary, and semantic accents.
*   define **shades up front** (e.g., 100–900), don't generate ad-hoc lightens/darkens.
*   "Grey" can be warm or cool; keep a consistent temperature.

**Contrast rules:**

*   normal text target: **≥ 4.5:1**
*   large text target: **≥ 3:1**

**Church colour psychology:**

*   Blues for trust and stability
*   Greens for growth and renewal
*   Warm tones (orange, amber) for welcome and warmth
*   Avoid overly corporate or cold palettes

### Elevation / shadow system

Use 3–5 shadow levels that map to meaning:

*   1: buttons/cards (subtle)
*   2: popovers/menus
*   3: sticky headers
*   4: modals
*   5: high priority overlays

### Borders

Prefer:

*   spacing,
*   subtle shadows,
*   or small background changes

over heavy borders.

### Empty states

Empty states are a first impression. They must:

*   explain what's empty,
*   why it matters,
*   and what to do next.

## Integration with Marketing Psychology

Apply principles from the marketing-psychology skill:

### Cognitive Load Reduction

*   Limit navigation options to 5-7 items maximum
*   Use progressive disclosure for detailed information
*   Group related information visually and logically
*   Apply the "law of proximity" - related items close together

### Social Proof Elements

*   Show photos of actual events and gatherings
*   Display service times and attendance numbers authentically
*   Highlight community impact stories and statistics

### Trust Building Elements

*   Clear statement of beliefs and values prominently displayed
*   Staff bios with photos and backgrounds
*   Clear denominational affiliation (if applicable)
*   Transparent financial information and giving reports

### Persuasive Design Elements

*   Use directional cues (arrows, gaze direction in photos) to guide attention
*   Apply the "rule of thirds" in image composition for visual appeal
*   Use color psychology appropriately (blues for trust, greens for growth, warm tones for welcome)
*   Implement scarcity principles ethically for limited-time events

---

## Integration with Copywriting Principles

Apply principles from the copywriting skill:

### Clear, Action-Oriented Language

*   Write headlines that are clear, not clever
*   Use active voice and strong verbs
*   Focus on benefits, not just features
*   Write like you speak - conversational and approachable

### Scannable Content Structure

*   Use the inverted pyramid: most important information first
*   Break text with descriptive subheadings
*   Use bullet points for lists of benefits or features
*   Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)

### Trust-Building Copy Elements

*   Include specific, concrete details rather than vague statements
*   Use social proof: "Join 200+ families who call [Church] home"
*   Address common objections proactively
*   Use language that reflects your actual church culture

*   Consider accelerated mobile pages (AMP) for blog content

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

*   Ensure color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
*   Provide alternative text for all meaningful images
*   Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the site
*   Use semantic HTML (proper heading levels, landmarks)
*   Provide captions and transcripts for audio/video content

### Security & Maintenance

*   Keep CMS, plugins, and themes updated
*   Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication

## Prompt Templates

### Church Website UX/UI Plan

```
You are designing a church website UI/UX.

1) Write a crisp design brief (first-timers, members, seekers, goals, constraints).
2) Define information architecture + navigation model for a church site.
3) Identify 1–3 key user paths: "Plan Your Visit", "Watch Sermon", "Get Involved".
4) Produce a component inventory for the key pages.
5) Propose a design token system (spacing, type, colour, radius, shadow) with rules.
6) Describe page layouts (mobile-first) and key interactions.
7) List empty/loading/error states (no upcoming events, no sermons, etc.).
8) Run a usability + accessibility + consistency pass; revise.

Output must be specific and implementable.
Avoid vague advice.
```

### Church Website Visual Polish Pass

```
Review this church website UI for visual quality.

- Fix hierarchy (what is primary vs secondary vs tertiary?)
- Fix spacing (grouping clarity; rhythm; alignment)
- Fix typography (scale, weights, line height, line length)
- Fix colour (contrast, palette consistency, accent usage)
- Fix depth (shadows/borders; focus on meaning)
- Improve empty states and microcopy

Return:
1) a list of concrete changes
2) updated tokens (if needed)
3) before/after descriptions of the most important screens.
```

### Church Website Usability "Glance Test"

```
Pretend you have 10 seconds to look at this church website page.

Answer:
- What is this page?
- Who is it for?
- What are the top 3 things I can do here?
- What is the primary action?
- Where is the navigation?
- Can I find service times and location?

Then list everything that created a question mark, and propose fixes.
```

### Church Website Accessibility Pass

```
Review this church website design for accessibility.

Check:
- text contrast (normal and large text)
- keyboard navigation and focus visibility
- semantic element choices (button vs link vs div)
- form labelling and error announcement
- motion and reduced-motion behaviour

Return:
1) issues grouped by severity
2) concrete fixes (design + implementation)
3) any token changes needed (colours, focus styles)
```

### Church Website Responsive Pass

```
Define responsive behaviour for this church website page/component.

For each breakpoint (small phone, large phone, tablet, desktop):
- layout (stack/columns)
- what becomes primary vs secondary
- how text wraps/truncates
- how tables, toolbars, and secondary actions adapt

Then list edge cases (long text, empty, error) and how they render.
```
