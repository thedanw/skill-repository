# Unsplash Integration

Use this skill to find specific Unsplash imagery for landing pages, hero sections, blog headers, and product design visuals.

## Goal

Search Unsplash directly and return the best options for the user’s brief.

## Search approach

1. Convert the need into a precise keyword phrase.
   - Example: `modern office teamwork`, `minimal product mockup`, `cozy cafe interior`
2. Build a direct Unsplash query URL:
   - `https://unsplash.com/s/photos/{keyword}`
3. Review the first 3–5 relevant images.
4. Prefer images with a clean subject and good composition.

## Output format

```markdown

## Best matches

1. {title} — Unsplash
   - URL: {image page link}
   - Why it fits: {reason}
   - Notes: {license / attribution note}

## Recommended pick

## Rules

- Always mention the specific Unsplash search URL pattern used.
- Prefer direct image pages or image links over generic text results.
- Keep the output concise and actionable.
- Explicitly note that license status should be checked before commercial publication.
