# Stock Photo Finder

Use this skill to find free, usable stock photography for web, marketing, landing pages, and creative assets. Prefer Unsplash first for editorial and hero-image use, then cross-check with Pexels, Pixabay, and Openverse when a broader set is needed.

## What to do

1. Clarify the visual brief:
   - subject matter
   - mood / style
   - color palette
   - orientation (portrait / landscape / square)
   - whether the image must be free for commercial use

2. Search in this order:
   - Unsplash: `https://unsplash.com/s/photos/{keyword}`
   - Pexels: `https://www.pexels.com/search/{keyword}/`
   - Pixabay: `https://pixabay.com/images/search/{keyword}/`
   - Openverse: `https://openverse.org/search?q={keyword}`

3. Shortlist the best 3–5 candidates.
   - prefer clear subject focus
   - prefer high resolution and clean composition
   - avoid cluttered or low-quality results

4. For each result, report:
   - source site
   - direct image URL or page URL
   - license / usage note
   - why it fits the brief

## Best practices

- Always note the source and license status.
- Prefer direct links to image pages when possible.
